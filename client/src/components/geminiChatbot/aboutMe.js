  bio: `I'm Samson Gidey — a fullstack MERN developer based in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
      I build complete, production ready web applications end-to-end: responsive and 
      pixel-perfect frontends with React, scalable REST API backends with Node.js and 
      Express, and reliable data layers with MongoDB.

      I don't just write code — I architect solutions. From authentication systems and 
      admin dashboards to real-time UI and e-commerce workflows, I handle the full 
      lifecycle of a web product independently.

      Beyond personal projects, I've delivered real client work company websites, 
      internal tools, and branded digital experiences for businesses in Ethiopia. 
      I bring both technical depth and design sensibility to every project, which means 
      what I build doesn't just work it looks professional.

      I'm actively seeking fullstack or MERN developer roles where I can contribute, 
      grow, and ship products that make a real impact.`,
